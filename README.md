 Password: `password`

 #### Whats is the difference between user 1 and user 2?
There's no difference at all...

#### How to change default username and password?
1. Open and edit this file: `/inc/login/login.json`
2. Chage the username as you wish
3. For the password, you can use [Bcrypt Generator](https://bcrypt-generator.com/) to encrypt and validate your password.
